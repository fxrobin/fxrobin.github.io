<div class="intro" markdown='1'>

I'm hosting for free all blanka's posts. Knowing him for years and concerned about his nervous behaviour tendance, I could not refuse when I received this email:


```
from: blanka@streetfighters.cap.com
to: fx@fxjavadevblog.fr

Blanka crushed you skull many times, but you are old friend of mine
Blanka wants internet hosting, Blanka wants to say his rage,
Blanka knows Markdown, Markdown is a friend of Blanka as well,
Blanka is waiting for a fast answer, otherwise Blanka will crush you skull!

Cheers, Blanka.
```

I was really happy to have some news from him. He may be in a good shape. He's going well and he's having professional and personal success in his life. It makes me feel good.

With this full of love message, I could not refuse! The next sections contain the posts of my old friend blanka.
